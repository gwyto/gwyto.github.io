<h1>Gabe's BMX Page</h1>
<h2>What is BMX?</h2>
  <p>Freestyle BMX is a type of extreme sport in which riders perform various stunts on terrain ranging from parking lots and city streets to dirt trails and elaborate skateparks. Its origins date back to the 1970s where legends such as Bob Haro would ride thier bicycles and ramps built for skateboards. Today, BMX has a much larger following and even debuted in the 2020 Olympic games. I have been riding BMX for around 18 years now and do not plan on stopping any time soon.</p>

<h2>Why Do I Ride?</h2>
<p>I fell in love with BMX at the young age of 12 years old. Back then, I would get around town on my bicycle as I was too young to drive and walking took too long. Sooner or later, my friends began buying these interesting bicycles that were made to do tricks on and I eventually got one myself. From that point forward I rode regularly and still have not stopped even at 30 years old. </p>
