<h1>Gabe's BMX</h1>
<h2>What is BMX?</h2>
  <p>Freestyle BMX is an extreme sport where riders perform stunts on terrain ranging from parking lots and city streets to dirt trails and elaborate skateparks. 
	  Its origins date back to the 1970s when legends such as Bob Haro would ride their bicycles and ramps originally intended for skateboards. 
	  From there, it evolved from a California punk crew's hobby to a worldwide sport. Today, BMX has a much larger following and even debuted in the 
	  2020 Olympic games. I have been riding BMX for 18 years and do not plan to stop anytime soon.</p>
	
<h2>Why Do I Ride?</h2>
<p>My love for BMX goes back to around the age of 12. At that time, I would get around town on my bicycle as I was too young to drive and walking was just too slow. 
	Sooner or later, my friends bought these neat bicycles built specifically to do tricks which I thought was cool. 
	I eventually saved up money and got one myself. From that point forward I rode regularly and still have not stopped...even at 30 years old! </p>
