  <h2>A Brief BMX History</h2>

  <p>In the 1970s people began racing bicycles on dirt tracks just like the motocross athletes of that era. 
This was the birth of BMX racing. Soon bicycle racing spread across the United States.</p>

  <p>Later on in the same decade, BMX pioneers such as Bob Haro and Devin and Todd Bank would ride thiers on ramps 
  originally built for skateboarders. This was the birth of another type of BMX called freestyle BMX.</p>
  <br>

  <p>Both freestyle BMX and BMX racing saw increased development and popularity over the next several decades. 
  Large competitions such as the "X Games" began being held in the 1990s and televised for an international audience.  </p>

  <p>Today, both BMX racing and Freestyle BMX remain popular extreme/action sports. In 2008, BMX racing became a medal 
  winning sport in the Olympics with freestyle BMX doing the same in 2017.</p>
